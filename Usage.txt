First, use CrystalTile2 (https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/818/) or equivalent to unpack the ROM.
Then grab one of the lng files inside the LOC folder.

To split the file, drag and drop it onto splitLang.bat, or run "python splitLang.py XXX.lng."

This will produce a set of files which are just numbered, since I can't be bothered to figure out
where everything is.

To merge everything back, just drag and drop onto mergeLang.bat, or run "python mergeLang.py XXX.lng."
This will produce a new file named output_XXX.lng, which you can then reinsert into the ROM.
