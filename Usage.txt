To split the file, drag and drop it onto splitLang.bat, or run "python splitLang.py XXX.lng."

This will produce a set of files which are just numbered, since I can't be bothered to figure out
where everything is.

To merge everything back, just drag and drop onto mergeLang.bat, or run "python mergeLang.py XXX.lng."
This will produce a new file named output_XXX.lng, which you can then reinsert into the ROM.

Unfortunately, it has been discovered that regular Notepad at least does not handle these files well.
You should use either a Hex Editor, or better yet Notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/). The key
thing is to ensure that the 00/NUL's are all still there.
