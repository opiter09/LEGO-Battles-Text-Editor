First, use CrystalTile2 (https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/818/) or equivalent to unpack the ROM.
Then grab one of the lng files inside the LOC folder.

To split the file, drag and drop it onto splitLang.bat, or run "python splitLang.py XXX.lng."

This will produce a set of files which are just numbered, since I can't be bothered to figure out
where everything is.

To merge everything back, just drag and drop onto mergeLang.bat, or run "python mergeLang.py XXX.lng."
This will produce a new file named output_XXX.lng, which you can then reinsert into the ROM.

Among the split files you will find a few that appear to be blank. Do NOT, under ANY circumstances,
EVER edit these files. Similarly, please completely avoid the file ByteCounts.txt. All of these
are needed for the back end of reconstruction, and should not be changed.
